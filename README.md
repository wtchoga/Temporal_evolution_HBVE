# Temporal_evolution_HBVE

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes liver-related complications and remains a significant global health concern. HBV consists of at least 10 genetically distinct genotypes (A-J) of which genotype E (HBV/E) has the least genetic diversity and a global prevalence that is estimated as <1%. Recently, we identified HBV/E circulating in Botswana in addition to the more common genotypes A and D. As genotype E predominantly circulates among populations in Western Africa and is associated with higher rates of chronicity compared to other genotypes, we investigated the evolutionary dynamics of HBV/E and its temporal spread in Botswana. Based on phylogenetic and phylogeographic reconstructions, we dated the emergence of HBV/E in Botswana to 2009 (HPD: 1994 â€“ 2009). HBV/E sequences from Botswana were most closely related to sequences circulating in Angola compared to those of other countries. The study demonstrates the recent introduction of HBV/E in Botswana and may aid int the mitigation of virus spread within at-risk individuals.
